# Installed Software Auditor

## Introduction

**Installed Software Auditor** is a single-file, read-only cybersecurity CLI + web-app tool, part of a 27-tool
suite built to simulate and perform real host, network and file forensics workflows — the kind a
security analyst runs day to day. One inventory of everything installed on a machine, across every package manager it has — then an audit of the result. Single Python file, a CLI and a 5-page web app, SQLite storage, SVG analytics, an approved-software baseline, and scan-to-scan change detection.

## 🌍 What Problem This Solves

Most security tooling is either:

* A paid, closed-source enterprise product
* A scattered pile of shell one-liners with no history or reporting
* Hard to audit, since you can't read the whole tool in one sitting

👉 **Installed Software Auditor** solves this by shipping as **one readable Python file** — CLI and web app together,
no hidden network calls, no telemetry, and a `selftest` command that proves every claim above
against a temporary database before you ever point it at your own machine.

## 💡 Core Concept

Instead of scattered, one-shot scripts:

💥 **Installed Software Auditor** uses a scan → store → score → report model

* Every scan is saved to SQLite, so you can compare runs over time
* Every finding carries evidence, not just a verdict
* Every chart is rendered server-side as SVG — nothing fetched from a CDN, nothing executed in
  the browser beyond the page itself

## 📊 Real Data, Hand-Rendered Visuals

This is **not** an animated mockup — it is a working tool that reads real data from this host or
the file/input you give it, and renders it with:

* 🎯 Server-side SVG charts (no JS charting library, no CDN)
* 📈 Scan-to-scan history and trend views
* 🔎 Filterable findings/results tables
* 🧭 A 404 handler and empty-state pages instead of blank crashes
* 💻 A CLI that mirrors everything the web app can do

## 🔥 Key Features (SEO Optimized)

* Read-only local analysis
* SQLite-backed scan history
* SVG analytics charts
* 5-page web dashboard

## 🧩 What It Covers

* Score gauge, per-manager source strip (ok / partial / unavailable / absent), severity cards, and every finding with evidence and a next step
* Full inventory with manager, version, size, install date, lifecycle status and baseline state; filter by manager, free text, past-EOL only, unapproved only
* Installed / removed / upgraded / downgraded since the previous scan
* Disk-footprint treemap, severity pie, packages by manager, largest packages, packages by section, score and package-count history
* Every scan, approval and export, with level filter and search

## 🖥️ CLI

```
python3 software_auditor.py <command> [options]

scan        inventory and audit          --role workstation|server|pentest|unknown
                                         --eol-file F  --show N  --quiet
show [ID]   summary of one scan          --limit N
packages    the inventory                --scan ID  --manager M  --search S
                                         --eol  --unapproved  --limit N
changes     what changed since last scan --scan ID  --kind K  --limit N
findings    findings from a scan         --scan ID  --severity S  --category C
sources     which managers this host has
eol         show the end-of-life table   --eol-file F
approve     record software as approved  --all | --key manager:name
revoke      remove from the baseline     --key manager:name
baseline    list approved software       --limit N
scans       list previous scans          --limit N
explain     what an inventory is for
serve       web app                      --host  --port  --debug
export      write a report               --format html|json|csv  --out F
logs        local event log              --level L  --limit N
purge       delete stored scans          --keep N | --all [--baseline]
selftest    verify every component (fixtures, temporary database)
version     versions, dependencies, disclaimer
```

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* 🐍 Python 3.12+ (standard library only for the core logic)
* 🌶️ Flask — web app (optional; the CLI works without it)
* 🗄️ SQLite — scan history and findings storage
* 🖼️ Hand-generated SVG — charts, no external JS/CSS dependency


## 🎨 Design Philosophy

* 🌑 Read-only by default — nothing is changed on the host or target
* 🧠 Evidence-first — every finding shows *why*, not just *what*
* 📊 Data clarity over clutter
* ⚡ One file, fully auditable
* 🎯 Analyst-focused UX, both in the terminal and the browser

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (AEO)

**What does Installed Software Auditor do?**
Installed Software Auditor is a read-only Python CLI and web app that one inventory of everything installed on a machine, across every package manager it has — then an audit of the result. Single Python file, a CLI and a 5-page web app, SQLite storage, SVG analytics, an approved-software baseline, and scan-to-scan change detection.

**Does Installed Software Auditor send any data over the network or to third parties?**
No. Installed Software Auditor performs local analysis only. There is no telemetry, no external API calls beyond
what its own documented function explicitly requires (if any), and no data leaves the host
unless you export a report yourself.

**Does Installed Software Auditor modify my system?**
No. It is read-only. It inspects and reports; it does not change configuration, files, or
running services.

**Is Installed Software Auditor a replacement for professional security software?**
No. It is a heuristic, educational and portfolio-grade tool. See the disclaimer below.

**What do I need to run Installed Software Auditor?**
Python 3.12 or newer. Flask is required only if you want the web app; the CLI works without it.
Run `python3 software_auditor.py selftest` first to verify your environment.

## ⚠️ Professional Disclaimer

🚨 **IMPORTANT — READ BEFORE RUNNING**

* ❌ This is **not** certified security software and carries **no warranty of any kind**.
* ❌ It does **not** replace a professional penetration test, a licensed forensic examiner, or
  commercial EDR/SIEM tooling.
* ❌ Findings are **heuristics, not proof**. A clean result does not mean a system is secure, and
  a flagged result does not mean it is compromised — verify everything manually.
* ✅ **Authorised use only.** Only run this against hosts, networks, files or accounts you own or
  have explicit written permission to test. Unauthorized scanning of systems you do not own or
  control may be illegal in your jurisdiction.
* ✅ **Read-only, offline by design.** No telemetry, no third-party services, no hidden network
  calls beyond what the tool's own documented purpose requires.
* ✅ The author accepts **no liability** for any loss, damage, misuse, or legal consequence
  arising from the use, misuse, or misinterpretation of this tool or its output.
* ✅ Reports produced by this tool can contain sensitive information (accounts, ports,
  configuration, personal data). Handle and share exported reports carefully.
